Generator for Wordpress admin pages


Admin page generator for Wordpress

This plugin will generate admin pages from json.


I found a lot of wordpress plugins quite complicated, different and confusing.
My goal was learning more about the Wordpress backend.
I learned a lot.

A debug feature is implemented.
Different debug categories can be enabled and disabled
This is very helpful in understanding the different stages in Wordpress
like plugin activation or install

This is a research project and I also use it for my blog on WOrdpress plugin development.

completed:

the plugin when installed will generate a menu adminGenerator.
the menu items contain some example pages generated from JSON.
The plugin has standard functions that handle data display and saving
through the web route or ajax.


There is more to be done....
